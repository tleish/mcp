# Deploying on Kubernetes

Reference manifests for running the MCP proxy in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Edit the ConfigMap with your server configuration
vim deploy/kubernetes/configmap.yaml

# 2. Create the Secret with your API tokens (not included in kustomize)
kubectl create namespace mcp
kubectl -n mcp create secret generic mcp-secrets \
  --from-literal=sentry-token=sntrys_...

# 3. Apply the manifests
kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes/
```

This creates:

- `mcp` namespace
- `mcp-proxy` Deployment (1 replica)
- `mcp-proxy` ClusterIP Service on port 8080
- `mcp-config` ConfigMap with your server configuration

The Secret must be created separately (step 2) to avoid committing real tokens to the repo.

## Configuration

### Server config via ConfigMap

Edit `deploy/kubernetes/configmap.yaml` with your MCP servers:

```yaml
data:
  servers.json: |
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sentry": {
          "url": "https://mcp.sentry.dev/sse",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer ${SENTRY_TOKEN}"
          }
        },
        "grafana": {
          "url": "https://grafana.internal/api/mcp/sse",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer ${GRAFANA_TOKEN}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

The proxy resolves `${VAR}` placeholders from environment variables at startup. This keeps tokens out of the ConfigMap.

### Secrets for tokens

Create the secret with your real tokens:

```bash
kubectl -n mcp create secret generic mcp-secrets \
  --from-literal=sentry-token=sntrys_abc123 \
  --from-literal=grafana-token=glsa_xyz789
```

Then reference each token in the Deployment env:

```yaml
env:
  - name: SENTRY_TOKEN
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: mcp-secrets
        key: sentry-token
  - name: GRAFANA_TOKEN
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: mcp-secrets
        key: grafana-token
```

### OAuth tokens via Secret

For backends that use OAuth (Sentry, Honeycomb, GitHub Copilot, etc.), `mcp` keeps issued access/refresh tokens and dynamic-client registrations in `auth.json`. In a pod with a read-only root filesystem, mounting a writable `auth.json` is awkward — instead, inject the contents directly via `MCP_AUTH_CONFIG`.

**1. Run the OAuth flow once on a workstation:**

```bash
mcp add sentry --remote https://mcp.sentry.dev
# completes browser flow, writes ~/.config/mcp/auth.json
```

**2. Push the resulting file into a Secret:**

```bash
kubectl -n mcp create secret generic mcp-auth \
  --from-file=auth.json=$HOME/.config/mcp/auth.json
```

> Use a Secret (not a ConfigMap) — the file contains live access tokens.

**3. Inject it as an env var in the Deployment:**

```yaml
env:
  - name: MCP_AUTH_CONFIG
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: mcp-auth
        key: auth.json
```

The proxy reads the inline JSON at startup and keeps it in an in-memory store. OAuth refresh and dynamic-client registration update the in-memory copy so refreshed tokens stay coherent across requests within the pod's lifetime. **Nothing is ever written to disk** — one `warn` log is emitted on the first save attempt. On pod restart, the Secret is re-read and in-memory mutations are discarded.

**Refresh strategy.** When refresh tokens are about to expire, rotate the Secret externally (sealed-secrets, external-secrets-operator, a CronJob that re-runs `mcp add`, etc.) and let the rolling update pick it up. The proxy itself is not designed to write back to the Secret.

**Limitation.** Since `MCP_AUTH_CONFIG` is read-only, you cannot run `mcp add <server>` against a running pod and have the registration persist. Always pre-provision the auth store on a workstation or in a one-off Job, then ship it via the Secret.

### Pinning the image version

Edit `deploy/kubernetes/kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
images:
  - name: ghcr.io/avelino/mcp
    newTag: "0.5.0"  # pin to a specific version
```

## Why `--insecure`?

The proxy refuses to bind non-loopback addresses without `--insecure`. In Kubernetes, the pod needs `0.0.0.0:8080` so the Service can route traffic to it. TLS termination happens at the Ingress or load balancer level, not at the proxy.

## Health probes

The proxy exposes `GET /health` returning:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "backends_configured": 3,
  "backends_connected": 2,
  "active_clients": 5,
  "tools": 42,
  "version": "0.5.0"
}
```

### Why the probes are configured this way

**Startup probe** — gives 30s (`failureThreshold: 6 * periodSeconds: 5`) for the process to start and begin backend discovery. Discovery is async, so the proxy serves immediately but backends connect in the background.

**Liveness probe** — checks every 30s that the process responds to HTTP. Backend failures are **degraded state**, not a reason to restart the pod. If sentry is down, the proxy still serves grafana tools fine.

**Readiness probe** — checks every 10s. The proxy is ready to serve as soon as it starts because it lazy-connects backends on first request. A probe failure here means the process itself is unhealthy.

> **Do not** use `backends_connected > 0` as a readiness condition. The proxy is designed to start with zero connections and connect on demand.

## Application logs

Application logs (`tracing` events from the proxy itself — startup, backend discovery, request errors, OAuth flows) go to **stderr** by default and are captured by the kubelet, so `kubectl logs` just works. Two env vars tune this for production:

```yaml
env:
  # EnvFilter syntax — silence noisy library logs, keep mcp at debug.
  - name: MCP_LOG_LEVEL
    value: "mcp=debug,hyper=warn,reqwest=warn,h2=warn"
  # Newline-delimited JSON, one event per line. Drop in any log driver
  # (Loki, Datadog, CloudWatch, Fluentd) without parsing rules.
  - name: MCP_LOG_FORMAT
    value: "json"
```

`MCP_LOG_LEVEL` follows `tracing`'s [EnvFilter](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) syntax. Set the global level with `info`/`debug`/`trace`, or scope per module with `target=level` separated by commas. The example above keeps the proxy at `debug` while silencing `hyper`/`reqwest`/`h2` chatter — which dominates request volume otherwise.

`MCP_LOG_FORMAT=json` swaps the human-readable formatter for newline-delimited JSON. Each line is a complete event with `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, and structured fields. Pair with the audit stream below and you get a single tail-able log surface — every line is JSON, no mixed formats.

```bash
# Live tail, all events:
kubectl -n mcp logs deploy/mcp-proxy -f

# Only proxy errors via jq:
kubectl -n mcp logs deploy/mcp-proxy -f | jq -c 'select(.level=="ERROR")'
```

> **Why stderr, not stdout, for app logs?** Audit logs go to **stdout** by default (`MCP_AUDIT_OUTPUT=file+stdout`) and they're the structured product surface. Application/tracing logs go to **stderr** as the diagnostic surface. Kubernetes captures both in the same `kubectl logs` stream by default — split them downstream with `jq` (audit lines have `method`/`identity`; tracing lines have `level`/`target`).

## Audit logging

By default, audit logging is disabled (`MCP_AUDIT_ENABLED=false`) because the scratch-based image has no writable filesystem.

**Option A: Stream to stdout (no PVC needed)**

Set `MCP_AUDIT_OUTPUT=stdout` in the Deployment env. Audit entries are emitted as JSON lines to stdout and captured by your cluster's log pipeline (Fluentd, Loki, CloudWatch, etc.). No persistent storage required.

> If you want **both** PVC persistence (queryable via `mcp logs` in `kubectl exec`) and the cluster log pipeline, use `MCP_AUDIT_OUTPUT=file+stdout` (this is the application default — you only need to set it if your config or other env overrides it).

**Option B: Persist to a PVC**

1. Set `MCP_AUDIT_ENABLED=true` in the Deployment env
2. Mount persistent storage at `/data`:

```yaml
# In deployment.yaml, replace the emptyDir volume:
volumes:
  - name: data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: mcp-audit-data
```

3. Uncomment `pvc.yaml` in `kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  # ...
  - pvc.yaml
```

4. Apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes/
```

Audit logs are written to `/data/audit/data` and indexed at `/data/audit/index` (controlled by `MCP_AUDIT_PATH` and `MCP_AUDIT_INDEX_PATH`).

## Security context

The manifests include a hardened security context:

```yaml
securityContext:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

The image is based on `scratch` — a static binary with no shell, no package manager, no libc. The process runs as UID 0 by default (the Dockerfile doesn't set `USER`), but `scratch` itself does not require root. The attack surface is minimal regardless of UID: no shell to exec into, no tools to exploit, read-only filesystem.

If your cluster policy requires `runAsNonRoot: true`, set a numeric `runAsUser` and ensure mounted volumes (`/tmp`, `/data`) are writable for that UID — either via `fsGroup` or an initContainer:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 65534
  runAsGroup: 65534
  fsGroup: 65534
```

## Scaling

Each replica is fully independent — own backend pool, own tool cache, own connections. There's no shared state, no leader election, no coordination needed.

Scaling to N replicas means:

- N independent connections to each backend
- N copies of the tool/resource/prompt cache in memory
- Clients are load-balanced across replicas by the Service

This is fine for most deployments. Be aware that stdio-based backends (which spawn child processes) will have N copies of each process running across the cluster.

## Graceful shutdown

When Kubernetes sends `SIGTERM` (during rolling updates or scale-down):

1. The proxy stops accepting new connections
2. In-flight requests finish normally
3. Backend clients are shut down in parallel (5s timeout each)
4. Total internal cleanup is bounded to ~10s

`terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30` in the Deployment gives enough headroom. After 30s, Kubernetes sends `SIGKILL`.

## Exposing outside the cluster

The Service is `ClusterIP` by default. To expose externally, add an Ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: mcp-proxy
  namespace: mcp
  annotations:
    # TLS termination at the ingress
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts: ["mcp.example.com"]
      secretName: mcp-tls
  rules:
    - host: mcp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: mcp-proxy
                port:
                  name: http
```

## Troubleshooting

### Pod starts but backends never connect

Check the ConfigMap config is valid JSON:

```bash
kubectl -n mcp get configmap mcp-config -o jsonpath='{.data.servers\.json}' | jq .
```

Check the proxy logs:

```bash
kubectl -n mcp logs deploy/mcp-proxy
```

Look for `[serve] discovering tools from ...` lines. If you see `failed to discover`, the backend URL or token is wrong.

### Health probe fails on startup

Increase the startup probe threshold:

```yaml
startupProbe:
  failureThreshold: 12  # 60s instead of 30s
  periodSeconds: 5
```

### Token not resolving

Ensure the Secret key matches what the Deployment env references, and that the `${VAR_NAME}` in the ConfigMap matches the env var name exactly. If a referenced env var is missing, the placeholder is replaced with an empty string silently — verify the resolved config by checking the proxy logs for authentication failures on backend connections.

### Read-only filesystem errors

If you see permission errors, make sure the `tmp` and `data` volumes are mounted. The scratch image has no writable paths without explicit volume mounts.
